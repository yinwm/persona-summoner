# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**persona-summoner** is a new repository that appears to be intended for AI persona generation, character creation, or personality simulation systems. The project is currently empty and awaiting initial development.

## Repository Status

This is a **fresh repository** with no commits or source code yet. The project's technology stack and architecture need to be established based on requirements.

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project, the following steps will likely be needed:

1. **Determine technology stack** - Ask the user about their preferred language/framework
2. **Initialize project structure** based on the chosen stack:
   - Node.js/TypeScript: `npm init` or `yarn init`
   - Python: Create `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`
   - Other languages: Set up appropriate configuration files
3. **Create foundational files**:
   - README.md with project description
   - .gitignore for the chosen technology
   - Configuration files (eslint, prettier, etc.)

## Project Architecture Considerations

Given the "persona-summoner" name, this project likely involves:

- **AI/ML components** for persona generation
- **Character or personality systems** 
- **Possible integrations** with AI APIs or models
- **User interface** for persona creation/management

## Development Guidelines

When establishing the project:

- **Follow security best practices** - Never commit API keys or secrets
- **Set up proper testing framework** early in development
- **Consider scalability** for persona generation and storage
- **Plan for modularity** to separate persona logic, UI, and data layers

## Git Configuration

- **Remote**: https://github.com/yinwm/persona-summoner.git
- **Main branch**: main
- **Git LFS**: Enabled for large files
- **Current status**: Clean (no commits yet)

## Future Updates

This CLAUDE.md should be updated once the project structure is established with:
- Specific build/run commands
- Testing procedures
- Architecture details
- Development workflow
